> A cloud-native C#  *unit* / *integration* / *load* testing **tool** that *`clusters`* *automatically*


Feature | ...
-|-
`Zero-configuration` | <font size=2> the host will automatically detect listeners using the `SSDP` protocal (*but yes, you can provide config in multiple ways if required*)</font>
`Supercharged CD` | <font size=2>Verfy light-weight. Deploys apps in `ms`. Save time, and frustration, doing more testing, and less waiting or configuring.</font>
`Real-time reporting` | <font size=2>Use the `theBFG` `host console` to monitor in real-time all aspects of your tests including errors, CPU, MEM and throughput</font>
`NO DSL or JAVA or other` scripting to learn | Use all the same tools you love & pure C# to define complex intergation test scenarios</font>
`Continuous Fuzzy testing` |<font size=2> `theBFG` can execute your test suites in different ways, not just in different orders</font>
`Create worker clusters` with ease | <font size=2>Simply run `theBFG` on as many instances as you required, 
`Supercharge EXISTING test-suites` | <font size=2>theBGF supports distributing work to a cluster that will work together to execute it as quickly as possible</font>
`Cloud scaleout` | <font size=2>To really push the boundaries of your App, Cloud functions can be used to host workers</font>
`NO API bleed` | <font size=2>If you out-grow `theBFG` or otherwise dont require its sevices anymore, delete its reference, its config classes and its gone. No refactor required.</font>


# TheBFG *flow*

1. Code your `app`

2. Create a `unit-test`

3. Install bfg

    `dotnet install tool thebfg`

5. Configure your `IDE` to deploy your `unit-test` on compile:
 
*AfterBuild:* `dotnet tool thebfg target {path/To/unit.test.dll}`

1. Spin up worker on the *same computer*, **or** **many *others***
   
`dotnet tool theBFG fire`

... and thats it. Each time you `compile` your `unit-test` will be deployed to all the workers you have setup and they will run the tests as you commanded.

*<h2>Integration or Automation test? Start the SUT and monitor it for failures</h2>*

6. Configure your `IDE` to deploy the  `app-under-test` on compile:
   
`dotnet thebfg launch {app} {path/To/unit.test.dll}`

7. Update your `test.dll` to download the App and get a reference to it

`nuget install thebfg`

```c#
// will install App into version folders nested -> app/target/dir/{version}/*.*
// will continuely monitor for fresh app updates and automatically update
// and launch it without having to restart your test - great for continuious
// stress testing or hyper CI/CD scenarios
var stop = theBFG.launch("app", "app/target/dir").Until(); 
```

....
repeat for as many `Apps` as your integration test depends on.

> Pro Tips: 
> - use *wildcard* `*.tests.dll` to target all tests of specific patterns inside a folder, will search recursively
> - use *\$* to target specific tests `...test.dll$any_test_you_want` inside a `.dll`
> 
> - No after build triggers? No Worries! theBFG also *monitors the target for changes*, reloading and *firing* on *every* update to bring advanced continious testing capabilities to any dev flow

# Modes

By default, your tests will run in the same ordering and sequence as your `IDE`

To alter the execution mode of a test, simply end any launch command with a mode. Feel free to compose modes together to produce unique testing workflows for different situations.

Mode | Application
-|-
`Continious` | Runs a test on a loop over and over, logging any exceptions and restarting after any crash
  Options| **exitAfter**: *timespan* 
`Burst` | cluster will run test in loop modes at intervals that will ebb-and-flow over time
Options | **rampUp**: *timespan* \| **minBurst**: *timespan* \| **maxBurst**: *timespan*
`Compete` | makes the cluster work through an entire test-suite in a *first* **exit**, *first* **wins** scenario
Options | **batchSize**: *number* \| *reactive* <font size=1>(watches the consumption rate and auto-adjustes for fastest speed)</font>
`Rapid` | each test agent in the cluster will spawn a number of worker processes, and run the test on each thread. Combine this with `dotnet` thread multi-threading and to expose any bottlenecks in your architectureÆ’s
  Options| **runsInParallal**: *timespan* 
`Continious` | Runs a test on a loop over and over, logging any exceptions and restarting after any crash
  Options| **exitAfter**: *timespan*
`Using` | Runs a test using a specific test platform
  Options| **dotnet**: *uses dotnet test, for .NET core* **vstest**: *uses full framework vstest bundled with visual studio* \| **custom**: [use any test runner](#test-runners)

> **Pro tip:** use the bfgAPI to better control and *instead* feed a `IObservable<Timespan>` to any of these *options*!

# Test Runners

Out of the box, theBFG works with `dotnet test` & `vstest.console.exe`. But in essence all it does it wrap the output streams, parsing and triggering different events along the way to feed the Test Arena. You can use this same technique, or a closer integration using theBFG API, to tune theBFG to your specific flow.

# The TestArena

TheBFG TestArena is a hyper-CD tool that allows you to understand whats going on *in realtime* through a web browser. It a minimal layer that is designed to supercharge TDD, while being pluggable into other systems / charts / CD pipelines as necessary.

## Own your data

All metics can be exported at the end of a run

`dotnet thebfg reload {export/Path}`

## Monitor Errors

Any exception that is thrown in your test is surfaced through the portal

## Real-time logs

Watch application output as it happens

Augment the stream with your own logging

`Cluster.Log.OnInfo/OnError/etc(msg)`

## Real-time metrics

Access Test Arena metrics and other bfg cluster vitals through a web-browser

<img src=broken.jpg>

 ... and you can add your own data points through the `bfgAPI`

 ```
 ```

## Real-time ports 

use [SignalR](http://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to subscribe to a real-time event feed using the `bfgAPI` to customise the integration for your specific  `use-case` ie. logging to [AppInsights](http://azure.microsoft.com/)


```
